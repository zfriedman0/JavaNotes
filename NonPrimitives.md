# Non-Primitive Data Types in Java
---
Non-primitive data types are called **reference types** because they refer to objects.

The main differences between **primitive** and **non-primitive** data types are:
- Primitive types in java are predefined and built into the language, while non-primitive types are created by the programmer (except for `String`).
- Non-primitive types can be used to call methods to perform certain operations, whereas primitive types cannot.
- Primitive types start with a lowecase letter (like `int`), while non-primitive types typically start with an uppercase letter (like `String`).
- Primitive types always hold a value, whereas non-primitive types can be `null`.
