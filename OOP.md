# What is OOP?
OOP stands for **Object-Oriented Programming**.

Procedural programming is about writing procedures or methods that perform operations on the data, while object-oriented programming is about **creating objects that contain both data and methods**.

Has several advantages:
- OOP is faster and easier to execute.
- OOP provides a clear structure for programs.
- OOP helps keep the Java code DRY ("Don't Repeat Yourself"), and makes the code easier to maintain, modify, and debug.
- OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time.

# Classes and Objects
Classes and objects are the two main aspects of OOP.

A **class** is a template for objects.
**An object is an instance of a class**.
When the individual objects are created, they inherit all the variables and methods from the class.
